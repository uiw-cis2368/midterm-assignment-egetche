      <h2 class="bio">A Little Bit of Info About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a Cybersecurity major and I held quite the interest in the field since I was in middle school, particularly because I learned that people fell victim to scams quite easily. When I found out that I could learn how to counter the wretched people that prey on others in the digital world, I was immediately hooked... I graduated from Thomas Alva Edison High School, located in San Antonio, Texas, in SAISD. I am 20 years old, and as you can most likely tell by the design of this website, I really like the color blue. As you'll see further below, I have a few goals. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="CareerGoals">My Goals</h2>
      <p>I don't have very many goals, but the main goals I do have are very important to me. First of all, I want to secure my degree in Cybersecurity, and hopefully graduate with a grade point average of at least 3.5 or higher. My second goal after obtaining my degree, is to go work either for USAA in their cyber security department, or to go work for University of the Incarnate Word so that I can at least be familiar with where I am working. My third and possibly final goal so far, is to obtain and maintain financial security through working at either of the aforementioned companies. A possible fourth goal of mine, is to maybe one day settle down and start a family, but that's in the distant future.
